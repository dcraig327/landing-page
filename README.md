# landing-page

## What?

1. layout
   a. logo is a link to this page
   b. navbar is 3 links to the sections
2. redesign to use a fictional company

## Recap?

the hardest parts were remembering the 2,3,4 arguments for margin. figuring out the hero seciton and how to keep the image exactly 50% and why there was this gap between the two sections in hero, which was solved by bottom aligning the image for some reason that worked.

still not happy with the header section. i don't believe it'll resize to 320px width and that should be the min target.

the information section. i thought another way to solve it was having the section width set to the same total width as the hero section, but spacing them around. doesn't line up properly.

happy with the quote section. using all 4 padding sides for the citation works well getting it where you need it. but of course that's only when using this super strict vw layout that i hope i never do again. there just has to be a better way, some form of compromise between vw and em.

let's say i was making a site people would frequent to every day. then for sure that layout would heavily use em's. but if it's just a one-time deal, vw may work.

not really happy with the border-radius either. it seems jank using the two values like that. it should know my element's width and height and adjust accordingly. perfectly round corners are going to be the most common use, it should know that.

## Redesign?

what website, what's being sold, where are the pictures, etc.?
